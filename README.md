# Architecture

This application is developed as a Tauri app. Due to the need to run the application on server boot (without a user logged in), there is a small webserver, which communicates with the Tauri app.

# Application Installation on Windows Server 2019

## Global WebView2 setup

Globally install WebView2. Tauri uses it to run and display the frontend code. Download and install it from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section). Install it for all users.

## Application Installation

> Under construction...

The main application can be installed with the delivered `.msi` file. To run the backend http server on server boot, the installed `.exe` needs to be added as a Windows task and executed on server boot. Don't forget to run the task even no user is logged in.

## Uninstall application

> Under construction...

The Windows task needs to be deleted manually. Afterwards, the application can be uninstalled normally.

# Project Setup

> âš  Please note that Windows .msi installers can only be created on Windows as cross-compilation doesn't work yet. Track progress [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/cross-platform).
